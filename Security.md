# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is a top priority for us. If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, we encourage you to report it directly to us. Please refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until it has been addressed.

To report a vulnerability, please contact:

**Email:** [ajayambule2003@gmail.com](mailto:ajayambule2003@gmail.com)

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide the following information:

- **Product version**: Specify the version of the application you are using.
- **Affected components**: Identify which part of the application is affected (e.g., `script.js`, `index.html`).
- **Vulnerability description**: Describe the nature of the vulnerability and how it can be exploited.
- **Reproduction steps**: Include detailed steps to reproduce the issue.

A member of the security team will review your report, confirm the vulnerability, assess its impact, and work on a fix. Once resolved, the fix will be applied to the main branch and included in the next release.

Thank you for helping us keep our application secure!
